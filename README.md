# Wikipedia Widener
Chrome extension that opens Wikipedia pages in wide mode if available. Addresses the new [2022 Vector Wikipedia skin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Skin) which defaults to a narrow column that doesn't use widescreen space. This Chrome extension prevents the need to log in to Wikipedia in order to set the wide-vew behavior as default.
